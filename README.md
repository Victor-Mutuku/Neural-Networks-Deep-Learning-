# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

---

## Objective
Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with TensorFlow/Keras Sequential API.

## Skills Demonstrated / Concepts Applied
- **Deep Learning & ANN Design:** Built ANN using Keras Sequential API with dense layers.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Normalized pixel values and converted labels to one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Engineering:** Flattened 28x28 images to 1D arrays for ANN input.
- **Activation Functions & Regularization:** Used ReLU for hidden layers, softmax for output layer, and applied Dropout to prevent overfitting.
- **Training & Backpropagation:** Trained the network using Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss (backpropagation handled by Keras).
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Selected number of epochs, batch size, and dropout rates to optimize performance.
- **Model Evaluation:** Measured performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report; visualized training/validation accuracy.
- **Model Persistence:** Saved and reloaded trained model (.h5) for reproducibility.

## Outputs / Visualizations
