# MNIST Handwritten Digit Classification

**Objective:** Classify handwritten digits using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN).

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Built ANN with dense layers using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Applied ReLU/Softmax activations, Dropout, and trained with Adam optimizer.
- Preprocessed data: normalized pixel values and one-hot encoded labels.
- Evaluated performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
- Saved and reloaded model (.h5) for reproducibility.

**Outputs:**
- Sample digit images with labels
- Training/validation accuracy plots
- Confusion matrix heatmap
